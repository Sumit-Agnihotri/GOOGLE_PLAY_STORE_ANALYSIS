Plot a bubble chart to analyze the relationship between app size (in MB) and average rating, with the bubble size representing the number of installs.
Include a filter to show only apps with a rating higher than 3.5 and that belong to the Game, Beauty ,business , commics , commication , Dating , Entertainment , social and event categories.
Reviews should be greater than 500 and the app name should not contain letter "S" and sentiment subjectivity should be more than 0.5 and highlight the Game Category chart in Pink color.
We have to translate the Beauty category in Hindi and Business category in Tamil and Dating category in German while showing it on Graphs. Installs should be more than 50k as well as this graph should work only between 5 PM IST to 7 PM IST apart from that time we should not show this graph in dashboard itself.
